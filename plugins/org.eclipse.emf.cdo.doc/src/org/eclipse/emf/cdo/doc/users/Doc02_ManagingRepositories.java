/**
 * Managing Repositories
 * <p>
 * CDO stores models and meta models in repositories. These repositories need to be created or,
 * if they already exist on a remote server, connected before they can be used in Eclipse.
 * The management of these repository connections happens in the {@link Doc_RepositoriesView}.
 * <p>
 * Currently CDO supports two different types of repository connections:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Connections to existing remote repositories, as explained in {@link Doc_RemoteRepositories}.
 * <li>Connections to newly created local repositories, as explained in {@link Doc_LocalRepositories}.
 * </ul>
 * Please note that the term {@link CDORepository repository} in the context of the CDO Explorer user interface refers to a <i>connection</i>
 * to a core-level {@link IRepository}, as opposed to referring to the {@link IRepository} itself. Information on
 * operating a CDO server and on creating and managing an {@link IRepository} can be found in the {@link org.eclipse.emf.cdo.doc.operators}.
 * <p>
 * The following sections explain how to create, rename, connect, disconnect, or delete repositories and how to work with branches.
 * <p>

   * Creating Repositories and Connections
   * <p>
   * The {@link Doc_RepositoriesView} provides a uniform way to work with different types of CDO repositories.
   * Only at creation or connection time the differences between the repository types become apparent.
   * <p>
   * The following sections explain how to use the different repository creation or connection wizards. Each of them
   * can be started by clicking on the green plus button on the CDO Repositories view's toolbar:

     * <p align="center">{@image repo-wizard-type-remote.png}
     * <p>
     * A double-click on the type option or a single click on the Next button advances to the next wizard page, on which the label

     * to be entered:
     * <p align="center">{@image repo-wizard-remote.png}

     * configured connections in the current workspace. It can also be changed later, see {@link Doc_RenamingConnections}.
     * <p>
     * The <b>host</b> and <b>port</b> fields specify the server of the repository to connect to, more exactly the {@link IAcceptor}
     * on that server that accepts connection requests for the targeted repository. See {@link Doc02_ConfiguringAcceptors} for operator details.
     * <p>
     * The <b>repositories</b> list shows the repositories that are discovered on the targeted server. Selecting a discovered repository
     * in this list copies the name of the selected repository into the repository name field.
     * <p>
     * The <b>repository name</b> field identifies the targeted repository on the specified CDO server.
     * See {@link Element_repository} on how to configure repository names on a CDO server.
     * <p>
     * The <b>user name</b> and <b>password</b> fields are only enabled if the targeted repository supports authentication.
     * See {@link Doc03_ManagingSecurity} on how to configure authentication and authorization in CDO repositories.

     * The <b>repository name</b> field specifies the name of the new local repository. It must be unique among all local repositories
     * in the current workspace. The name of the repository can, in contrast to the label of the connection, not be changed anymore,
     * once the repository is created.
     * <p>
     * The <b>versioning mode</b> determines whether the history of changed models is preserved (for example to be used in
     * {@link Doc_HistoricalCheckouts} and with the {@link Doc_TimeMachineView}) and whether branches are supported.
     * The versioning mode of the repository can not be changed anymore, once the repository is created.
     * <p>
     * The <b>ID generation</b> determines where (server or client) and how (counters or UUIDs) IDs for new model elements are generated.
     * Server-side counter IDs are the more efficient option, but they prevent the repository to be used in replicated scenarios, such as
     * {@link Doc_CloneRepositories offline clone repositories} or {@link Doc_OfflineCheckouts offline checkouts}. For those scenarios
     * client-side UUIDs should be selected.
     * The ID generation of the repository can not be changed anymore, once the repository is created.
     * <p>
     * The optional <b>TCP port</b> field specifies on what port a {@link ITCPAcceptor} will accept incoming connection requests.
     * By default this option is disabled because local repositories run in the same Java VM as the hosting Eclipse IDE, and are
     * always accepting connection requests from there through an implicit {@link IJVMAcceptor}, too.
