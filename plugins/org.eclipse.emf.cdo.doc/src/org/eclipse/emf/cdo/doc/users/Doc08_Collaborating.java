/**
 * Collaborating in Real-Time
 * <p>
 * CDO supports real-time collaboration on models by transferring the changes that one user
 * {@link CDOTransaction#commit(org.eclipse.core.runtime.IProgressMonitor) commits} to the repository to all
 * other users connected to the same repository and transparently weaving those changes into their model copies.
 * <p align="center">{@image collaborating.png}
 * <p>
 * With CDO the local model copies (in particular with {@link Doc_TransactionalCheckouts online transactional checkouts}) do not need to be
 * <i>updated</i> manually; they are automatically updated (almost) at the time they are changed by other users.
 * <p>
 * As real-time collaboration relies on committing a {@link CDOTransaction transaction} it applies only to
 * online transactional checkouts and the {@link Doc_EditingModelElementsEditor editors}
 * opened on online transactional models. Saving a model editor commits the underlying transaction.
 * <p>
 * The data integrity of the models and model elements in a repository is guaranteed by {@link LockType#WRITE write locks}
 * that are acquired <b>per model element</b>. {@link LockType#READ Read locks} and {@link LockType#OPTION write options},
 * as well as {@link CDOView#enableDurableLocking() durable locks} are supported by the core-level APIs
 * but not by the CDO Explorer's user interface.

   * Optimistic Locking
   * <p>
   * By default model elements are locked optimistically, that is, the CDO server <i>implicitly</i> acquires and releases locks while executing
   * a commit operation. These implicit locks are not visible to the committing user or any other user of the same repository.
   * <p>
   * Optimistic locking provides for the highest possible degree of concurrency but it also comes with a non-zero risk of commit conflicts
   * that are only detected when a commit operation is executed by the CDO server and, as a consequence, rejected. Because of
   * {@link Doc_EarlyConflictDetection} the risk of conflicts that are detected that late in the commit process is generally much lower
   * than, for example, in pure database-based applications.

     * these conflicts are categorized as being either <i>trivial</i> conflicts or <i>non-trivial</i> conflicts. Trivial conflicts are:

     * <p>
     * Trivial conflicts are merged automatically into the local transaction, i.e., no user interaction is involved.
     * <p>
     * When non-trivial changes are detected, i.e., changes to the same single-valued {@link EStructuralFeature feature} on both sides (local and remote)
     * of the same model element, automatic conflict resolution is suspended for all model elements until the next local commit operation.

     *      in the meantime, in which case interactive conflict resolution is triggered again.
     * <li> If the Rollback action is selected the local transaction is {@link CDOTransaction#rollback() rolled back} and the local model copies
     *      are automatically updated to their latest remote versions. As a result all local changes will be lost and eventually need to be

  /**
   * Pessimistic Locking
   * <p>
   * Sometimes it seems not desirable to risk commit conflicts as they can occur with {@link Doc_OptimisticLocking}.
   * In these cases CDO supports the acquisition of <i>explicit</i> locks on selected models (see {@link Doc_TreeLocking}) and model elements.
   * <p>
   * Pessimistic locking support consists of:
   * <ul>
   * <li> Lock and unlock actions
   * <li> Lock state visualization
   * </ul>
   * <p>
   * Whether custom user interface components, such as model editors or views, support local actions and/or lock state visualization depends
   * on the implementation of those components. The CDO Model Editor's context menu offers lock actions for model elements that are not locked
   * by anyone and unlock actions for model elements that are locked by the current user. Both the CDO Model Editor and the
   * {@link Doc_ProjectExplorerIntegration} support lock state visualization by decorating model elements that are locked by the current user
   * with a green lock icon (indicating that they can be modified) and model elements that are locked by other users with a red lock icon
   * (indicating that they can not be modified):
   * <p align="center">{@image pessimistic-locking.png}
   * <p>
   * Note that a CDO editor generally operates in the context of a separate transaction, in particular not in the context of the
   * {@link CDOView read-only view} of the associated checkout, which explains why, in the screen shot above, both checkouts show the
   * locked model elements with a red lock icon decoration. In other words, while a model element is locked in a CDO editor it can not be
   * modified directly in the associated checkout via the Project Explorer.
