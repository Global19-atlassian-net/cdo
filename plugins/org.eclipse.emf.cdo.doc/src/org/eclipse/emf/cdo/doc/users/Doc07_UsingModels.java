   * Creating Model Elements

   * slightly different depending on whether the new model element is supposed to be created at the root of an existing
   * {@link Doc_CreatingModelResources model resource}, in which case arbitrary element types are allowed, or whether it is supposed
   * to be created under an existing typed model element, in which case the choice of element types is already determined by the
   * type of the existing container element.
   * <p>
   * In any case, new model elements are created by selecting the container, i.e., a model resource
   * or an existing model element that can have children, opening the context menu and opening the New sub menu.
   * This sub menu looks different depending on the type of the container. It is explained in the following two sub sections.

     * <p>
     * The first group of the New sub menu contains sub menus for all {@link EPackage packages} that are already used in the repository of the
     * selected checkout. A package sub menu contains creation actions for all concrete {@link EClass classes} of that package.
     * <p>
     * The second group of the New sub menu contains the Other action, which, upon selection, will open the following dialog:
     * <p align="center">{@image new-root-object-dialog.png}
     * <p>
     * The New Root Object dialog is horizontally split.
     * The left side shows all registered packages with the icons of not-yet-loaded packages being grayed out. The filter field on top
     * of the package list can be used to narrow down the choice of packages.
     * The right side shows all concrete classes of the package select on the left side. The filter field on top
     * of the class list can be used to narrow down the choice of classes.
     * <p>
     * When a class is selected and OK is pressed an instance of that class is created and inserted at the root level of the
     * containing model resource. Double-clicking the class has the same effect.
