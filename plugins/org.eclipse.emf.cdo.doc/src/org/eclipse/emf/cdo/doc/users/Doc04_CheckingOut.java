/**
 * Checking Out from Repositories
 * <p>
 * To be able to work with the models in a CDO repository they need to be checked out from that repository.
 * A checkout represents a <i>named</i> combination of the following pieces of information:
 * <ul>
 * <li> A configured repository (see {@link Doc_CreatingRepositories} for details on how to create and configure repositories),
 * <li> a {@link CDOBranchPoint branch point} that determines from what {@link CDOBranchPoint#getBranch() branch} and from
 *      what {@link CDOBranchPoint#getTimeStamp() time} the models of the checkout are shown, and
 * <li> an object to be used as the root object of the checkout's model tree. By default this is the
 *      {@link CDOView#getRootResource() root resource} of the repository.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The most obvious way to start the checkout process is to select a repository or branch in the {@link Doc_RepositoriesView},
 * open the context menu and select the Checkout action or the Checkout As action. Other ways are explained in {@link Doc_CheckoutWizard},
 * {@link Doc_DuplicatingCheckouts}, and {@link Doc_HistoryIntegration}.
 * <p>
 * The Checkout action involves no further dialog interaction, but immediately creates a {@link Doc_TransactionalCheckouts transactional} checkout
 * with default values for all settings. The following sections describe the different {@link Doc_CheckoutWizard checkout wizard} pages in detail.
 * <p>
 * <b>Table of Contents</b> {@toc}
