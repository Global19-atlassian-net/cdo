/**
 * Working with Checkouts
 * <p>
 * The key concept of working with models in the {@link Doc_ProjectExplorerIntegration Project Explorer} is a {@link CDOCheckout checkout}.
 * See {@link Doc04_CheckingOut} for details on how to to create {@link Doc_TransactionalCheckouts online transactional checkouts},
 * {@link Doc_HistoricalCheckouts online historical checkouts}, and {@link Doc_OfflineCheckouts offline checkouts}.
 * <p>
 * A checkout represents a <i>named</i> combination of the following pieces of information:
 * <ul>
 * <li> A configured repository (see {@link Doc_CreatingRepositories} for details on how to create and configure repositories),
 * <li> a {@link CDOBranchPoint branch point} that determines from what {@link CDOBranchPoint#getBranch() branch} and from
 *      what {@link CDOBranchPoint#getTimeStamp() time} the models of the checkout are shown, and
 * <li> an object to be used as the root object of the checkout's model tree. By default this is the
 *      {@link CDOView#getRootResource() root resource} of the repository.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Once created, checkouts are displayed in the Project Explorer like workspace projects and decorated with a small blue repository image.
 * In contrast to workspace projects the displayed checkouts have no physical representation in the workspace. <p align="center">{@image project-explorer.png}
