 * Working with Folders and Resources
 * <p>
 * The models of a checkout are organized in the virtual file system (aka resource tree) of a repository. This resource tree
 * consists of folders and different types of resources, all categorized as {@link CDOResourceNode resource nodes}.
 * <p>
 * All modifications of the resource tree that are triggered in the {@link Doc_ProjectExplorerIntegration Project Explorer}
 * are performed in a separate background {@link CDOTransaction transaction}, see {@link Doc_BackgroundTransactions} for details.
 * <p>
 * Modifying the resource tree is only possible in checkouts that are not read-only, i.e., not in {@link Doc_HistoricalCheckouts}.
