 * One endpoint of a physical connection of arbitrary nature between two communicating parties. A {@link IConnector}
 * encapsulates the process of establishing and closing such connections and has a

 * {@link org.eclipse.net4j.ILocationAware.Location#CLIENT CLIENT} or
 * {@link org.eclipse.net4j.ILocationAware.Location#SERVER SERVER} with respect to this process. Once a connection is
 * established either party can use its connector to open multiple {@link IChannel}s to asynchronously exchange
 * {@link IBuffer}s.

 * This interface is <b>not</b> intended to be implemented by clients. Providers of connectors for new physical
 * connection types have to implement org.eclipse.internal.net4j.connector.InternalConnector.
